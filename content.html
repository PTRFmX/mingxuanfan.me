							<h3>Computer Networks</h3>
							<p>
								What is computer network? In general, the computer network is a collection that connects all the distributed computing systems all over the world. It is mainly composed of two main subjects, one of which is the computer, the modern electrical device that we use everyday. Another is the “network”, aiming at providing intercommunication of information between computers.
							</p>
							<p>
								How does the network works? It turns out that information can only be sent given the hosts’ IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. To easily understand these concepts, you can think of the computer networks as the delivery system. The communicating process is similar to the action of you writing a letter to your friend. The language that you use is the “protocol”, your friend’s home address is the “IP address”, and the mailbox number is the “port number”.

							<h3>Cyber Attacks</h3>
							<h5>Man-in-the-middle attack</h5>
							<p>
								A very common cyberattack is called the “Man-in-the-middle” attack. Let’s continue the delivery system example introduced above. Imagine if there’s a bad guy disguised himself as the postman, then he can take out your letter, read your message, maliciously modify the content, put it back into the envelope and send it to your friend. Your friend thus receives a false message from you.
							</p>
							<h5>DDoS (Distributed denial of Service) attack</h5>
							<p>
								Such attack is where the attacker sends overwhelming trash message to the victim through a large zombie network and thereby paralyzes the victim. This is similar to a “postman” filling your mailbox with thousands of trash letters so that you can’t distinguish which one is from your friend. As a result, you’re unable to respond to your friend’s message.
							</p>
							<h5>General Vulnerabilities</h5>
							<p>
								This attack utilizes the unsafe measures to get controls over the victim’s system without authorization. A simple example is that if you forget to lock the door when you leave home, then thieves can easily get in.
							</p>

							<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
							<h5>Counter MITM attack</h5>
							<p>
								It is relatively easy to prevent MITM attacks through encryption. Encode your message by a shared method that only you and your friend know. Then seal the envelop with your unique signature. In this way, if the attacker takes out your letter, he/she can’t read the encrypted message. Moreover, your friend knows if the attacker has broken the seal.
							</p>
							<h5>Counter DDoS attack</h5>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, there are no methods that can prevent DDoS attack completely. Common resolutions include putting systems on well-guarded cloud platforms such as CloudFlare or AWS. Back to the example, this is similar to hiring guards to protect your mailbox.
							</p>
							<h5>Vulnerability detection</h5>
							<p>
								The main idea of this solution is to check all possible loopholes of your system, like closing the window, locking the door, and securing the key when you leave home.

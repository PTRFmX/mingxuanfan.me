							<h3>Computer Networks</h3>
							<p>
								What is computer network? In general, the computer network is a collection that connects all the distributed computing systems all over the world. It is mainly composed of two main subjects, one of which is the computer, the modern electrical device that we use everyday. Another is the “network”, aiming at providing intercommunication of information between computers.
							</p>
							<p>
								How does the network works? It turns out that information can only be sent given the hosts’ IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. To easily understand these concepts, you can think of the computer networks as the delivery system. The communicating process is similar to the action of you writing a letter to your friend. The language that you use is the “protocol”, your friend’s home address is the “IP address”, and the mailbox number is the “port number”.

							<h3>Cyber Attacks</h3>
							<h5>Man-in-the-middle attack</h5>
							<p>
								A very common cyberattack is called the “Man-in-the-middle” attack, where the attacker maliciously pretend as the server to the client and as the client to the server. In this way, all data passed between the two hosts will be intercepted by the attacker, who can thus benefit from the private information of the victim such as credit card number and social account password.  
							</p>

							<p>
								What’s worse is that the victim is unconscious of what happened. Due to the double identity of the attacker, neither the client nor the server are able to see through the attacker’s disguise. Often times, the attacker can escape from this kind of cyber crime.
							</p>
							<h5>DDoS (Distributed denial of Service) attack</h5>
							<p>
								Such attack is where the attacker sends overwhelming trash message to the victim through a large zombie network and thereby paralyzes the victim. The effectiveness of this attack depends on the capacity of the zombie network that the attacker control, which is highly expensive and time-consuming to build. However, if he capacity is large enough, the damage that it costs is also quite appalling. It can immediately “destroy” sites that are overwhelmed, shutting down their service systems.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/cat125/ddos.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="" />
							<p>
								Nevertheless, common personal users are unlikely to be attacked by DDoS since it often targets at massive online service platforms, usually products by dot-com companies.
							</p>
							<h5>General Vulnerabilities</h5>
							<p>
								This attack utilizes the unsafe measures to get controls over the victim’s system without authorization. The word “vulnerability” refers to the inability of a system to protect itself in a hostile environment. This type of attack is considered the primary attack in the current cyber world, as vulnerabilities are ubiquitous on the Internet.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/cat125/sql-injections.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="" />
							<p>
								The severity of consequences depends on the level of vulnerability being attacked. In the worst case where the attacker acquires the ROOT permission, the whole system will be compromised.

							<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
							<h5>Prevention of MITM attack</h5>
							<p>
								It is relatively easy to prevent MITM attacks through some encryption methods of modern cryptography. The most common example is the HTTPS protocol where we use on a daily basis. The HTTPS protocol contains TLS encryption that utilizes an asymmetric encryption to encrypt a key for later symmetric encryption of message exchange. (For more information, please refer to the link in the reference page).
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/cat125/tls-ssl.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="" />
							<p>
								In this way, the attacker are very unlikely to be able to read or modify the message even if it gets intercepted due to the attacker’s inability to decipher the encrypted data. The validity and safety of message transfer are thus guaranteed.
							</p>
							<h5>Counter DDoS attack</h5>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, there are no methods that can prevent DDoS attack completely. Common resolutions include setting up a backup site or filtering HTTP requests do not resolve the problem fundamentally. The easiest approach is to put websites on well-guarded cloud platforms such as CloudFlare or AWS.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/cat125/cloudflare.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="" />
							<p>
								The reason why few methods can prevent DDoS attack is that such attack is “violent”. It follows the rule of data transfer but overwhelm victims with absolute advantage of power.
							</p>
							<h5>Vulnerability detection</h5>
							<p>
								The most effective way to detect whether a service is a vulnerability is to mimic the attacking process towards the service. Vulnerability detection is the most common job for penetration testers. They perform a comprehensive test(attack) on basically every possible cases on potentially vulnerable services and thereby clears out dangers in a system.
